TouchML Database Structure:

Table: trials

Fields:

id: prmary key of this table

trialMode: id of the task (1-8), randomised between participants by a latin square design; values:
1: crosshair target, thumb input
2: crosshair target, index finger input
3: key sized target, thumb input
4: key sized target, index finger input
5: app sized target, thumb input
6: app sized target, index finger input
7: full width target, thumb input
8: full width target, index finger input

sessionIndex: indicates whether this trial was part of a user's first or second session - 0 (first session), 1 (second session)

inputStyle: the hand posture in this trial - 0 (thumb input), 1 (index finger input)

surfaceX: x-offset of the targeting area on the screen in pixels (can be ignored - always 0 here)
surfaceY: y-offset of the targeting area on the screen in pixels (can be ignored - always 0 here)

surfaceW: width of targeting area in pixels (always 1080 here) - this value is the horizontal resolution of the Nexus 5
surfaceH: height of targeting area in pixels (always 1701 here) - this value is the vertical resolution of the Nexus 5 minus the space needed for the phone's OS softkeys and status bar

screenW: width of whole screen in pixels (Nexus 5: 1080)
screenH: height of whole screen in pixels (Nexus 5: 1776) - this value is the vertical resolution of the Nexus 5 minus the space needed for the phone's OS softkeys

subjectID: id of the participant who performed this trial




Table: taps

Fields:

targetX: x coordinate of the target centre in pixels
targetY: y coordinate of the target centre in pixels
targetW: width of the target in pixels
targetH: height of the target in pixels

touchDownX: x coordinate of touch event at touch down in pixels
touchDownY: y coordinate of touch event at touch down in pixels

touchUpX: x coordinate of touch event at touch up in pixels
touchUpY: y coordinate of touch event at touch up in pixels

hit: flag indicating whether the touch up fell inside the target rectangle - 0 (miss), 1 (hit); do not interprete this value for crosshair targets (as they have no visible bounding box)

timeDown: time at touch down, in milliseconds since the start of the trial
timeDown: time at touch up, in milliseconds since the start of the trial

trialID: id of the trial (i.e. row in table trials), to which this touch belongs
